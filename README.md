# CheckySpecky
Automated code checks against your specs. Spec-driven development, made easy.

CheckySpecky is an open source tool for spec-driven development. It uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically review your code and documentation, checking how closely your implementation follows your written specifications.

This tool is designed for teams and developers who write specs first—whether for APIs, services, or libraries—and want an automated way to make sure code and docs stay in sync with those specs. CheckySpecky fits naturally into LLM-assisted coding workflows and helps catch gaps or mismatches early.

- *Input:* Your codebase and your formal specs (usually markdown files)
- *Output:* A clear report highlighting where your code matches—or diverges from—your specs
- *Goal:* Reduce manual review, improve spec adherence, and streamline spec-first development

CheckySpecky is easy to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline or use locally as a developer tool.
